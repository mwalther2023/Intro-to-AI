# Assignment Repository - Starter Code

This repository contains the starter code for assignment 4. The objective of this assignment is to implement, test, and improve various maching learning algorithms using the provided Python scripts and CSV data files. You will be exploring multiple algorithms, and interpreting their outcome. There is no autograder for this assignment.

## Repository Contents

- **Python Files**: All your edits should be in the `.py` files.
- **CSV Files**: These are the data files that you will need to train your machine learning models

## Instructions
Full instructions for this assignment are on Canvas!


## Submission

1. **Submit your Best Model**: As part of this assignment, you'll be training and evaluating different models. After experimenting, save the model you deem to be the best as `bestModel` (the format will be specified in the assignment details).

2. **Push Changes**: Once you're satisfied with your solution and you've added your `bestModel` file, push your changes back to your personal assignment repository. The following commands can be used as a guide:
    ```bash
    git add bestModel.output
    git commit -m "Completed the assignment and added bestModel"
    git push origin main
    ```


Ensure that before the deadline:

- All your changes to the `.py` files have been pushed to the repository.
- You've added your `bestModel` file to the repository.
- You've uploaded your report to **Canvas**

After pushing your changes, double-check the contents of your repository on GitHub to ensure all files have been updated correctly.
